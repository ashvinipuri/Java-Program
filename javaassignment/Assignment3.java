//3.    Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
//a.    'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
//b.    'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
//c.    'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.
